# Program-Assignment-1
# To-Do List Application (Java Conversion)

For this assignment, I am converting my previous Python To-Do List application into a Java program. For the Java version, I am simplifying the project by starting with a console-based application instead of building a graphical user interface. This will allow me to focus on translating the core logic from Python to Java, including handling user input, managing a list, and structuring the program using Java classes and methods.
As an enhancement, I plan to add a priority feature. When a user adds a task, the program will ask whether the task is a priority item. If it is marked as priority, the task will be inserted at the top of the list instead of the bottom. This adds additional logic beyond the original Python version and makes the program more useful and interactive.
